# About the MetaboAnalyst Sets

These metabolite sets were extracted from MetaboAnalystR using
[this github's scripts](https://github.com/cbragdon93/metaboAnalystLibraries/ "MetaboAnalystSetExtraction")

The main level contains the metabolite sets using the compound's names.
In METABOANALYST\_WITH\_HMDB, the metabolite sets are represented using
HMDB IDs instead of compound name.
